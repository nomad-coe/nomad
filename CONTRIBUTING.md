# Contributing

We maintain two git repositories that you can contribute to. The default choice for
external contributors should be the [GitHUB project](https://github.com/nomad-coe/nomad)
project. Please you the normal [GitHub-Flow](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) targeting the `develop` branch.

NOMAD's [GitHUB project](https://github.com/nomad-coe/nomad) always contains the current `develop` branch.
It can be used to report issues, fork the project, and to create pull requests. After review, pull requests
will be pushed to the GitLab project and merged there.

NOMAD's [GitLab project](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/nomad-lab/nomad-FAIR) at [MPCDF](https://www.mpcdf.mpg.de/)
is used for the main development activities. It runs all CI/CD pipelines and official deployments.
It is openly readable, but requires an MPCDF account for active contributions.

Most sub-modules, e.g. NOMAD's parsers, are hosted in individual projects on GitHUB
within the [nomad-coe organization](https://github.com/nomad-coe).
