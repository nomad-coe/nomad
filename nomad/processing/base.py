class Proc(Document):
    """
    Base class for objects that are subject to processing and need persistent processing
    state. The processing state is persisted in mongo db. Possible processing statuses are
    defined by :class:`ProcessStatus`.

    To initiate a process, an object subclassing Proc must first be created using
    :func:`create`. Processes are then initiated by calling a *process function* on this
    object, which is a member function marked with the decorator @process. Calling a process
    function sets the process_state to PENDING and a celery task is created, which will be
    picked up by a worker, which sets the state to RUNNING and actually executes the
    process function.

    From process_status RUNNING, the process can transition to either SUCCESS, FAILURE or
    WAITING_FOR_RESULT, or result in the deletion of the process object itself (for example
    the process for deleting an upload).

    WAITING_FOR_RESULT means the process needs to wait for the result from spawned child
    processes. When a child process finishes, it will call `try_to_join` on the parent, and
    if it is the parent's last running child process, we will switch to the parent Proc,
    put its status to RUNNING and execute the `join` method on the parent.

    To send the process to status WAITING_FOR_RESULT, the process function must return
    normally, without errors and exceptions, and return the value `ProcessStatus.WAITING_FOR_RESULT`.

    If the process deletes the object itself, the process function should instead return
    `ProcessStatus.DELETED`. If the process function returns normally, without exception
    and without a return value, the process status will be set to SUCCESS.


    Attributes:
        errors: a list of errors that happened during processing.
            NOTE: This value is managed by the framework, do not tamper with this value.
            To fail a process, an exception should be raised.
        warnings: a list of warnings that happened during processing. Warnings do not
            fail a processing run
        last_status_message: A short, human-readable message from the current process, with
            information about what the current process is doing, or information about the
            completion (successful or not) of the last process, if no process is currently
            running.
        complete_time: the time that processing completed (successfully or not).
            NOTE: This value is managed by the framework, do not tamper with this value.
        current_process: the currently or last run asynchronous process
            NOTE: This value is managed by the framework, do not tamper with this value.
        process_status: one of the values defined by :class:`ProcessStatus`.
            NOTE: This value is managed by the framework, do not tamper with this value.
        queue: A list defining queued up calls, waiting to be run. Each item is a triple
            of [func_name, args, kwargs].
            NOTE: This value is managed by the framework, do not tamper with this value.
        sync_counter: An integer, incremented every time a "sync" operation is executed,
            to ensure state consistency and atomicity. There are three types of sync operations:
            when scheduling a process, starting a process, and completing a process.

            1)  There is something in the queue, and the current process was successful
                -> We set status to PENDING and return the next process.
            2)  There is something in the queue, and the current process FAILED:
                -> Behaviour depends on the process decorator flag `clear_queue_on_failure`
                   and the parameter `force_clear_queue_on_failure`:
                        If either is True: We clear the queue, set status to FAILURE and return None.
                        Otherwise: We set status to PENDING and return the next process.
            3)  There is nothing in the queue:
                -> We set the status to the provided value and return None

        This is one of three *sync operations*. See :func:`_sync_schedule_process`

    The decorator for functions that process locally. These work similarly to functions
    marked with the `@process` decorator, but they are executed directly, in the current
    thread, not via celery. Consequently, they can only be started if no other process is
    running. They are also implicitly blocking, i.e. while running, no other process
    (local or celery-based) can be started or scheduled on the same object. It can also not
    spawn child processes and wait for them using the WAITING_FOR_RESULT mechanism, or itself
    be a child process (as this means joining with a parent process when done).

    If successful, a local process can return a value to the caller (unlike celery processes).
    If unsuccessful, an exception will be raised (note that the usual process handling is
    always applied, i.e. we set self.process_status, self.errors etc. accordingly). The Proc
    object should not have any unsaved changes when a local process is invoked.
