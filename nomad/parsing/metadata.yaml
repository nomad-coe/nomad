preamble: |
  This is not a real parser, but an example template on how to write one. You can fork this repository to create actual parsers.

  ## Get started

  You should create a virtual environment. This is optional, but highly recommended as
  the required nomad-lab pypi package requires many dependencies with specific versions
  that might conflict with other libraries that you have installed. This was tested
  with Python 3.9.

  ```
  pip install virtualenv
  virtualenv -p `which python3` .pyenv
  source .pyenv/bin/activate
  ```

  Simply install our pypi package with pip:
  ```
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install nomad-lab
  ```

  Clone this project (or fork and then clone the fork). Go into the cloned directly and
  directly run the parser from there:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/nomad-coe/nomad-parser-nexus.git parser-nexus
  cd parser-nexus
  python -m nexusutils tests/data/nexus.out
  ```

  There are also a basic test framework written in [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
  Install the remaining dev dependencies and run the tests with:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pytest -sv tests
  ```

  ## Next steps

  Our documentation provides several resources that might be interesting:
  - [How to write a parser](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/rae/docs/parser.html). Provides
    a more detailed tutorial on how to write a parser.
  - [Introduction to the NOMAD Metainfo](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/rae/docs/metainfo.html).
    This explains how NOMAD data schema and can be extended and used within your parser.

  To get you parser included in NOMAD or ask further questions, you can:
  - Use our forums at [matsci.org](https://matsci.org/c/nomad/32)
  - Open an issue on the [nexus-parser GitHub project](https://github.com/nomad-coe/nomad-parser-nexus/issues)
  - Write to [support@nomad-lab.eu](mailto:support@nomad-lab.eu)

  **Note!** The rest of this README.md is the usual text that applies to all NOMAD parsers.
