                  In cases where the specimen was e.g. site-specifically cut from
                  samples or in cases of an instrument session during which multiple
                  specimens are loaded, the name has to be descriptive enough to 
                  resolve which specimen was taken. This field must not be used for an
                  alias of the specimen. Instead, use short_title.
                  
                  In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
                  the name has to identify the specific one, whose results are stored
                  by this NXentry, because a single NXentry should be used only for
                  the characterization of a single specimen.
                  Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
                  sample history.
