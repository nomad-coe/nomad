                description: |
                  Chemical composition of the sample. The composition from e.g.
                  a composition table can be added as individual strings.
                  One string for each element with statements separated via a
                  single space. The string is expected to have the following format:
                  Symbol value unit +- stdev
                  
                  An example: B 1. +- 0.2, means
                  composition of boron 1. at.-% +- 0.2 at.%.
                  If a string contains only a symbol this is interpreted
                  that the symbol specifies the matrix or remainder element
                  for the composition table.
                  
                  If unit is omitted or named % this is interpreted as at.-%.
                  Unit can be at% or wt% but all strings have to use either atom
                  or weight percent but no mixtures.
                  No unit for stdev should be repeated as it has to be the
                  same unit as is used for the composition value.

                  Qualitative statement about which reconstruction protocol was used.
                  Bas maps currently to bas_modified.
                  Cameca maps currently to apsuite.
                  Add more details in the parameter text field,
                  e.g. reconstruction parameter.

                  Different reconstruction protocols exist. Although these approaches
                  are qualitatively similar, each protocol uses different parameters
                  (and interprets these differently). The source code to IVAS/APSuite
                  is not open. For now users should store reconstruction parameter
                  in a collection, i.e. here with a free-text field.

                  Different strategies for crystallographic calibration of the
                  reconstruction are possible. The field is required and details
                  should be specified in free-text at least. If the not crystallographic
                  calibration was performed the field should be filled with the n/a,
                  meaning not applied.
