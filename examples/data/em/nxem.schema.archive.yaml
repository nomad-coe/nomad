# pynxtools-em implements a multi-format-capable reader whose design strategy is to work towards
# that injection of metadata via an ELN should be reduced to the minimum amount of work possible
# as proprietary file formats typically include already a substantial amount of contextualization of the
# microscope session and thus there should not be a need that users have to enter these pieces
# of information again
# the em reader accepts customizable yaml documents that can be used to inject metadata
# that are specific to a microscope also to reduce the pieces of information which users need
# to enter into the ELN
# many electron microscopy labs have ELN solutions running the data inputted into these
# should be parsed rather directly to the em reader rather than by reengineering a NOMAD OASIS
# ELN template like the one here
